        "## 1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled Languages:\n",
        "- A compiled language translates the entire source code into machine code before execution, resulting in a standalone executable. Examples include C, C++, and Rust.\n",
        "- Compilation typically results in faster execution since the program is already in machine-readable format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted Languages:\n",
        "- An interpreted language processes the source code line-by-line at runtime. The interpreter reads and executes each line, which allows for immediate execution but generally results in slower performance.\n",
        "- Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are examples of interpreted languages, offering flexibility and ease of debugging.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception Handling refers to the process of responding to runtime errors (exceptions) that disrupt the normal flow of a program. In Python, this is achieved using the `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to manage errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The finally block ensures that certain cleanup actions are performed regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. This is useful for releasing resources such as closing files or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Logging is a way to track events during program execution. It provides a means to output messages for debugging or monitoring purposes, helping developers understand program behavior. Python's built-in `logging` module supports different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and can log messages to various destinations (console, files).\n",

        "## 5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The `__del__` method, or destructor, is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows for cleanup actions such as closing files or releasing resources that are no longer needed.\n",

        "## 6. What is the difference between import and from import in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Import Statement: Imports an entire module into the current namespace. For example:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  import math\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  You access functions using `math.function_name`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- From Import Statement: Imports specific attributes or functions directly into your namespace:\n",
        "  ```python\n",
        "  from math import sqrt\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  You can use `sqrt` directly without prefixing it with `math`.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple exceptions can be handled using a tuple in the `except` clause:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    # code that may raise an exception\n",
        "except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n",

        "## 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically managing file opening and closing. It ensures that resources are properly released after their use, even if an error occurs:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
        "    data = file.read()\n",

        "## 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multithreading involves running multiple threads within a single process, sharing memory space but potentially leading to race conditions.\n",
        "- Multiprocessing runs multiple processes independently with their own memory space, avoiding shared memory issues but incurring higher overhead due to inter-process communication.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## 11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management in Python involves automatic allocation and deallocation of memory through a garbage collector that recycles unused memory, preventing memory leaks and optimizing resource usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Try Block: Code that may cause an exception is placed inside a `try` block.\n",
        "2. Except Block: If an exception occurs, control transfers to the `except` block for error handling.\n",
        "3. Else Block: This optional block runs if no exceptions were raised.\n",
        "4. Finally Block: Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred, often used for cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Effective memory management ensures applications run efficiently without exhausting system resources, preventing crashes and improving performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The try block contains code that might raise an exception, while the except block handles exceptions if they occur, allowing for graceful recovery from errors without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by tracking object references. When an object's reference count drops to zero (meaning it's no longer accessible), it gets deallocated. Additionally, Python uses cyclic garbage collection to identify and collect objects involved in reference cycles.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The else block runs if no exceptions were raised in the try block, allowing for code that should only execute when no errors occur.\n",

        "\n",
        "- os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current process; itâ€™s specific to Unix-like operating systems.\n",
        "- multiprocessing module provides a higher-level interface for creating processes that work across platforms (Windows and Unix) and includes features like process synchronization and communication.\n",

        "\n",
        "Closing files ensures all data is flushed from buffers and resources are released back to the operating system, preventing data corruption or resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- file.read() reads the entire content of a file at once.\n",
